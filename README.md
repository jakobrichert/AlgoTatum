# ALGOTATUM
 Algorand NFT Marketplace using Tatum API 


**************************WARNING THIS CODE IS NOT MEANT FOR PRODUCTION USAGE AND IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS****************************************


# Known Issues 

Due to the holidays and time crunch I experienced while working on this, there is not much of the backend completed while most of the frontend is completed. 

While working on this I learned a lot about tatum API calls and blockchain development in general and hope I can finish this even after the bounty has expired. '
